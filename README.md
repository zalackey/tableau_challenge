## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to help the client glean usuable business information from the New York City Citi Bike data from the month of August. The analysis shows that most users are subscribers who most likely use the bikes as commuters due to the regularity of their stop and stop times during the weekdays. Most rides are around 8 or 9 AM and 5 to 6 PM, which aligns with a regular work day and work schedule for commuters. 

Results:

## Visualizations in Story Explained:
1. The Peak Hours Visualization shows the hours during the day where the most bike trips occur, which are between 8 or 9 AM and 5 to 6 PM.
2. The Total Trips By User Type chart shows how many trips were taken by users sorted by subscribers vs nonsubscriber customers
3. The next chart shows the trip duration for which a bike is checked out for, which shows most trips are under an hour.
4. The following chart relates to the previous trip duration chart and breaks that metric further by filtering on gender, 0 meaning gender unknown, 2 being male, and 3 being female. 
5. The next heatmap breaks the trip into the seven days of the week and hours of the day. The darker the rectangle, the more trips on that hour in the given day. This also illustrates the working commuter schedule being the primary user of the bikes. 
6. The next heatmap filters the previous one by gender with 0 meaning gender unknown, 2 being male, and 3 being female.
7. The heatmap of the user types broken into the same gender categories reveals that the subscriber type most commuting on the bikes are male.

Summary:

The data reveals that most of the users are subscribers, and that they tend to use the bikes during a regular 5 day work week to commute during regular business hours most likely a 9 to 5 schedule. Visualizations to consider for the future would be to use the stop and start station IDs along with the bike ID to identify the average distance travelled on each trip and to add the filter of birth year to the user types by gender viualization to further understand the demographics.
